# candy
My first project for Boots.dev.
It's a simple game based on the project Asteroids.
The plot is roughly like this:
You are a mage. Of course ... The Grand Magus is sick and candy is running low.
You take it opon yourself to fix the issue and make more candy on your own.
Magical candy is hard to create or it wouldn't normally need the Grand Magus to do it.
You have to overcome some challenges, but look for yourself.
